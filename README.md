Service 1:

Committee work
One of the things I've felt very passionate about during my PhD has been organizing with the Harvard graduate student union, HGSU-UAW, where I have been serving as the co-chair of the grievance committee. In my first 7 months as co-chair, we received about 200 grievance intakes, and in all cases so far we have been of immense help to students. Our support consists of securing additional compensation in cases of workload violations, fighting for interim measures in cases of harassment and discrimination, providing legal and emotional support for students facing disciplinary actions, etc. It has been incredibly gratifying to see what difference we make to people's lives, and I also think I have gained some invaluable communication and managerial skills. Apart from that, I have also served on a couple of other Harvard-affiliated committees including the APS-IDEA group and a joint faculty-student mental health committee at the Center for Astrophysics.

Food organizations
A topic I think about quite often is that of how to be sustainable in a self-sustaining manner. While in Cambridge, UK, I was volunteering with an organization called FoodCycle, which collected left-over food from grocery stores and prepared meals for underprivileged members of the community. Before the pandemic started, I also volunteered with Family Meals, a local organization in Cambridge, MA, that packaged food from the Harvard dining halls and delivered it to shelters in the area. I'm hoping to become engaged in this service again once it is safe to do so.

Teaching:
The Astrophysics department at Princeton offered the wonderful opportunity to teach as part of the Prison Teaching Initiative at a couple of detention centers. I was happy to see the enthusiasm and kindness with which my efforts were received and also amazed at how much I learned from my students. It was also an eye-opening experience in terms of realizing the shortcomings of the prison industrial complex.

Mentoring:
I am currently a non-resident tutor at one of the undergraduate houses at Harvard, Pforzheimer House. This involves participating in and organizing community events and also providing emotional and academic support to undergraduate students. I get a lot of pleasure from connecting with the students, as hearing about their aspirations and exchanging ideas can be quite inspirational! At Cambridge University, I served as Vice President of the Bulgarian society CantaBulgarian, where I helped with organizing community events for Bulgarians living in the area such as movie nights, baking challenges, and mentorship sessions for applicants from Bulgaria.

Tutoring:
At Princeton, I took up several opportunities to tutor students: I designed a short cosmology class for the Princeton SPLASH program and helped lead a short introductory class on Bulgarian along with several other Bulgarians during Wintersession. My first summer I also tutored math and physics at a local summer school in Plainsboro, NJ, where I prepared gifted students for the SAT and ACT standardized tests. I am also listed as a tutor on the Tutors against Covid project, founded by a fellow graduate student, although so far my contributions have been limited.
