    <h1 style="color:turquoise;">Welcome to my crib</h1>

    <p style="color:turquoise;">
      I originally come from Sofia, Bulgaria, and am currently <br>
      a graduate student at the Center for Astrophysics (CfA),<br>
      working with Prof. Daniel Eisenstein and Prof. Lars Hernquist<br>
      on various concepts in (mostly) theoretical cosmology.
    </p>
    <p style="color:turquoise;">
      Most recently, my focus has been on testing the validity of <br>
      and extending population models such as the halo occupation <br>
      distribution (HOD) and subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) in <br>
      hydrodynamical simulations. The simulation data that we have <br>
      been employing is IllustrisTNG (add website link), which is a <br>
      state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation developed by teams <br>
      at Harvard and MPI, Munich.
    </p>
    <p style="color:turquoise;">
      Another part of my research is the development of the N-body <br>
      simulation code Abacus along with Lehman Garrison, Daniel Eisenstein, <br>
      Nina Maksimova and Sownak Bose. My main contribution to Abacus <br>
      has been the development of a new halo-finding algorithm, called <br>
      CompaSO as well as some of the post- and pre-processing software.
      (add link) CompaSO is...

      I have a keen interest in many other aspects of theoretical cosmology <br>
      such as improving our modeling of photometric redshifts in current <br>
      and future galaxy surveys, cross-correlation studies between large-<br>
      scale structure and early Universe signatures like the cosmic <br>
      microwave background, which was the focus of my undergraduate <br>
      studies. Add more...

    <p style="color:turquoise;">
      Apart from astronomical research, I serve as the co-chair of the <br>
      Grievance Committee at the Harvard Graduate Student Union (HGSU), <br>
      which protects and advocates for other student workers who may be <br>
      experiencing unfair treatment at the workplace. We can help out <br>
      with issues ranging from (but not limited to) discrimination <br>
      complaints, underpayment concerns, and disciplinary hearings. <br>
      Harvard Graduate students can reach out with issues via this <br>
      confidential form (add link). In addition, our committee aims to <br>
      educate the graduate student body about their rights and benefits <br>
      as specified in our contract. If you have any questions regarding <br>
      the contract, please send an email to hgsu.grievance@protonmail.com.

      Another initiative that feels dear to me is the APS-IDEA group. <br>
      The mission of that group is to revolutionize the culture of the CfA <br>
      so that our institute becomes a cultural leader in astrophysics for <br>
      justice, equity, and inclusivity. We hope to achieve this through open, <br>
      transparent, and curiosity-driven strategic planning and initiatives for <br>
      improving equity, diversity, belonging, and inclusion with sustained <br>
      actionable implementation. My participation is as a member of the steering <br>
      committee which meet monthly and follows closely the execution of individual <br>
      projects, as well as two other subcommittees: one for developing and <br>
      distributing a CfA-wide climate survey and for improving and initiating <br>
      sustainability efforts at the CfA. (add link)

      In my many hours of free time, I like biking to quiet places in nature, <br>
      singing at the graduate student choir (and outside it, too), reading classic <br>
      novels, learning new languages, supporting social justice issues as best as I <br>
      can, philosophizing on any topic you can name, and eating lots of desserts! <br>
      Recently my partner and I have taken up the difficult task of maintaining <br>
      a small vegetable garden, but have yet to reap the fruits of our labor.
    </p>
    <p style="color:turquoise;">
      I am also a member of the LGBTQ+ community and am open to talk to anyone <br>
      about it! In my opinion, it is of crucial importance to provide relentless <br>
      support and to treat everyone with love and kindness.

    <p style="color:turquoise;">
      TODO: include list of publications, CV, images from papers and results.
      More about CMB stuff perhaps.
